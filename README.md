# Twitter-Sentiment
This is a project which I did  during my course
We have 2 csv files : train.csv and test.csv

We are given Tweets of people mentioning certain airline companies : tweets are both negative and positive.

We are then given test data for several tweets and we have to classify the category of tweet:negative,positive,neutral.
